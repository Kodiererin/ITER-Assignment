/*7. A baseball playerâ€™s batting average is calculated as the number of hits divided by the official number
of at-bats. In calculating official at-bats, walks, sacrifices, and occasions when hit by the pitch are
not counted. Write a program that takes an input file containing player numbers and batting records.
Trips to the plate are coded in the batting record as follows: H-hit, O-out, W-walk, S-sacrifice, P-hit
by pitch. The program should output for each player the input data followed by the batting average.
Each batting record is followed by a newline character. Your program should not use any kind of
array and array processing.
