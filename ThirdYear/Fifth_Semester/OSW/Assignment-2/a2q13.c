/*13. Keiths Sheet Music needs a program to implement its music teachers discount policy. The program is
to prompt the user to enter the purchase total and to indicate whether the purchaser is a teacher. The
store plans to give each customer a printed receipt, so your program is to create a nicely formatted file
called receipt.txt. Music teachers receive a 10% discount on their sheet music purchases unless the
purchase total is $100 or higher. In that case, the discount is 12%. The discount calculation occurs
before addition of the 5% sales tax. Here are two sample output filesone for a teacher and one for a
nonteacher.
Total purchases $122.00
Teacherâ€™s discount (12%) 14.64
Discounted total 107.36
Sales tax (5%) 5.37
Total $112.73
Total purchases $24.90
Sales tax (5%) 1.25
Total $26.15
Note: to display a % sign, place two % signs in the format string:
printf("%d%%", SALES_TAX);
To write the output in the file receipt.txt use output redirection, ./a.out > receipt.txt*/
