/*5. Consider the C arithmetic expression 2 ∗ ((i%5) ∗ (4 + (j − 3)/(k + 2))) where i , j and k are integer
variables. If these variables are assigned the values 8, 15 and 4, respectively, then the given determine
the value of the expression. (Note: The interpretation of the remainder operation (%) is unclear
when one of the operands is negative. Most versions of C assign the sign of the first operand to the
remainder. The % operation is undefined when second operand is zero.)*/
