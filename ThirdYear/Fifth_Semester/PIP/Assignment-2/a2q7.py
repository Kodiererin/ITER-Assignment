# 7. Write a function areaTriangle that takes the lengths of three sides: side1, side2, and side3 of the
# triangle as the input parameters and returns the area of the triangle as the output. Also, assert that sum
# of the length of any two sides is greater than the third side. Write a function main that accepts inputs
# from the user interactively and computes the area of the triangle using the function areaTriangle.
