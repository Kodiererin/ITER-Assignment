# 2. Give the range in which value of variable x may lie on execution of the following statements:
# import random
# x = random.random() + 5
import random
print(random.Random())

# The random.random() function in Python returns a random float in the range [0.0, 1.0). When you add 5 to this random float, the resulting value (x) will be in the range [5.0, 6.0). In other words, x will be greater than or equal to 5.0 and less than 6.0.
