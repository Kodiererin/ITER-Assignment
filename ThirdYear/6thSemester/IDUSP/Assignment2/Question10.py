# 10. What are random variables? Give two examples.

# Random variables are variables that can take on different values randomly according to some probability distribution. They represent the outcomes of a random phenomenon. There are two types of random variables: discrete and continuous.
#
# Discrete Random Variable: A random variable that can take on a countable number of distinct values. Examples include:
# Number of heads obtained when flipping three coins.
# Number of students who pass an exam out of a group of 50 students.
# Continuous Random Variable: A random variable that can take on any value within a given range. Examples include:
# Height of a person.
# Temperature of a city.
