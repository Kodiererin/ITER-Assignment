# # 11. What are independent events? Give two examples of the same
#
# Independent events are events where the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other event. In probability theory, two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of A does not affect the probability of B, and vice versa.
#
# Two examples of independent events:
#
# Flipping a Coin: The outcome of one coin flip does not affect the outcome of another coin flip. If we flip a fair coin twice, the outcome of the first flip (heads or tails) does not influence the outcome of the second flip.
# Rolling Dice: Rolling a fair six-sided die twice. The outcome of the first roll does not affect the outcome of the second roll. The probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., 3) on the second roll remains the same regardless of the outcome of the first roll.
