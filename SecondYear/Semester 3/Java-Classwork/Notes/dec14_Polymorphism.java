//Polymorphishhm Means Same thing in more than one form is called Polymorphism.
//Sum() - if the function is able to find the sum of two Integer and more than two integer function then it is called Polymorphism.
//Polymorphism is of two types : Compile Time polymorphism and Second One is Runtime Polymorphism.
//1. The function call binds with respective object at compile time  is called Compile Time.
//	 eg: Function Overloading();     Same function perform operation on different set of data.
//	Compile Time polymorphism is  also called Compile Binding.
//	Sequence,type and no of arguments the Function overloading Works.
//	Sometimes the arguments are type casted 
	
//	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//	Run Time Polymorphishm : Function call associated during the runtime is called Run time Polymorphism.
//	Function overwriting.
//	When there are same function which has been inherited from parent class to child class.
//	If we create object of child class.
//	So the method of the child class will be overriden with the parent class.  -> This is called Overriding.
//	
//	Parent p = new Parent();
//	p.function 				// output of the Parent function .
	
//	child p = new child();
//	p.fuction				// output of the child function.

//	Parent p = new child()
//	p.function 				// outfut of the child funciton  


//	Reference is created at Object time and Object is created During runtime.
