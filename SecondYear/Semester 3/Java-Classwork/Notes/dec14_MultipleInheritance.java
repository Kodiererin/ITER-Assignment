//	Multiple inhheritance in Java using Interface
//	Difficulties in Multiple Inheritance
//	Interface is complete abstract class.
//	It provides 100% abstraction.
//	Interface is used to crreate abstraction forll all mmber function and members.
//	Abstract is not 100 % abstraction.
//	We cannot create an object of an interface.
//	Interface is used to create a hierarchy.
//	Member variable of the Interface is static and final by default.
//	if Interface is not able to create any object so the Member variable of the interface is static and final always.
//	In method there is no body of the inteface.
//	ANd class which want to use Interface can use the interface by using implement keyword.
//	The mehod that is present in the interface that must be override by the child class...
