// Assignmenton JavaQ1. Write a program to count number of bits of an integer number.Note: Use bit wise operator.Q2. T parity of a binary word is 1 if the number of 1s in the word is odd; otherwise, it is 0. Write a program to compute the parity of a very large numberof 64-bits.Q3. Write a program to swap the ith bit with jth bit of a 64-bits integer number.Q4. Compute xXy without arithmetic operator.Note: Use bitwise operator.Q5. Write a program to find the reverse of a string.Note: Use StringBuffer classQ6. Write a program to count number of word present in a string.Note: Use split functionQ7. Write a programwhich read a name and date of birth(DOB)create a password which consist of the first two latter of the name and month from DOB.Q8. Write a program which reads two integer number of any length from user and find it sum.Note: Donâ€™tuse bigintegerclass.Q9. Write a program which encode the spreadsheet column.Example:A is encoded to 1B is encoded to 2.....Z is encoded to 26ZA is encoded to 27Q10. Write a program which read a number and base1 and base2and convert the number of base1 to base2
